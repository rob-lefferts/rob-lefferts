# Hello, I'm Rob Lefferts.

## Why I'm here...
I'm a Mechanical Engineer by degree who is working to get into the software field in either a Data Science or a Development role.

## Some background...
I do have some experience in software development in both professional and hobby capacities:
- I've developed software for automated manufacturing equipment which included TwinCAT PLC and HMI development. This also included network access, multiple levels of access for the machine, creation and communication with a SQL database which held machine parameters, and VBScript for more advanced HMI functionality.
- I've developed software for semi-automated lab testing equipment which included TwinCAT PLC and HMI development. I also developed an algorithm that analyzed testing results and determined the critical datapoint from the test.
- Using Excel VBA and formulas, I've developed semi-automated methods of extracting and formatting raw data from a test lab into a format setup to obtain quick visualization and analysis of large amounts of data points. This method was utilized by colleagues to speed up their data analysis as well.
- I developed software for a patent prototype as a consultant which involved integrating motor control and QR code scanner with an Arduino microcontroller. I also developed a GUI using Visual C# to control the device, read its output, and run a demo of the product.

## What I'm currently learning...
- I've been taking classes in Python, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
- I've been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
