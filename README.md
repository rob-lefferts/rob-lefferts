# Hello, I'm Rob Lefferts.

## Who am I?
I'm a Mechanical Engineer by degree and currently a Software Engineer by career, formerly a Mechanical Design Engineer (although I still do a good amount of that, too). I work with industrial automation systems, robots, device-to-device communication, motor control, and I enjoy getting different devices to talk, creating intuitive GUI's for equipment/devices, and designing reusable code. I love computers, code, astronomy, camping, sports, and my family.
